## Nimified 'Dodge the Creeps' and 'Game of Life'

Make sure you have Godot(3.0+) and Nim(1.0+) and the [bindings](https://github.com/pragmagic/godot-nim) installed when you want to try these out. Run `nake build` in a samples directory to get started.
Code isn't pretty as I'm still learning and I wrote this to orientate myself around both projects.

Thanks to Skaruts for bringing the samples up to date for Nim 1.0

### TODO

Add the sound effects and particles to the Dodge the Creeps project.
