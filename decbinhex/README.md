I used all newest stable stuff to make this. Godot 3.4, Nim 1.6.0, Godot-Nim 0.8.5* (`requires "https://github.com/dsrw/godot-nim#f2af444"`, see https://github.com/pragmagic/godot-nim/pull/114 ). Otherwise, normal build process.

Also there's a tiny bit of code (on the hidden polygon) for direct movement. No point yet but it should be helpful info on its own for actual simple games (and my next goal).

Note that I'm a beginner with both Nim and Godot (this is part of my learning and hopefully will do more with Godot-Nim), feel free to give me advice (insomniac_lemon on Reddit) or to simply fix any small technical mistakes/practices (can't say that I'll get it, but I'll look at the changes).
